# Kosogor

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/TanVD/kosogor.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/TanVD/kosogor)

Kosogor is a plugin which provides reasonable defaults and simplified Kotlin-DSL interface to Gradle plugins and API functions used in everyday development.

The idea behind Kosogor is to reduce the size  of your build.gradle.kts and remove from it all the boilerplate: setting
plugins configurations which should be default or using verbose plugin interfaces when you don't need such flexibility.

It includes simplified Kotlin-DSL interfaces for:
* IDEA plugin
* Jar + SourceJar + Maven-Publication + Artifactory
* ShadowJar

Also, it provides reasonable defaults (which, nevertheless, can be overridden) for:
* IDEA plugin
* Wrapper
* Build dir + Clean task


## Setup

Kosogor is released to `plugins.gradle.org`

To setup it just apply plugin: 

```
plugins {
    id("tanvd.kosogor") version "1.0.0" apply true
}
```
## What's inside

The only thing you need to get all the defaults is to apply Kosogor plugin. 

### Default configuration

The default configuration of Kosogor plugin on apply will:
* Apply `idea` plugin if not applied. The default configuration will add to `excluded` most of the build and tmp dirs, 
gradle utility files and so on. Also, will be enabled download of javadocs, sources for dependencies and inheritance
of output dirs 
* Setup `wrapper` version to latest stable.
* Setup global build dir for projects (each project will be built below own project dir inside of global). This behavior 
is similar to IntelliJ IDEA behavior with flag `inheritOutputDirs`. Also, `clean` tasks in projects will be updated (or 
created if not existed) to remove build dirs created.

### PublishJar

Kosogor includes facade to a collection of publishing tasks implemented by `Jar`, `maven-publish`, `com.jfrog.artifactory` APIs.

The facade is quite simple. You just use `publishJar` lambda and passes to it in a declarative Kotlin-DSL format configuration you need:

```kotlin
publishJar {
    jar {
        publication = "myPreciousLibrary"
    }
    
    sources {
        task = "sourcesJar"
    }
    
    artifactory {
        artifactoryUrl = "https://artifactory.server.com"
        artifactoryRepo = "artifactory-repo"
        artifactoryUser = "artifactory-user"
        artifactoryKey = System.getenv("artifactory_key")
    }
}

```

This simple code will create Jar publication named `myPreciousLibrary` and task generating Jar with sources named `sourcesJar`. 
Then it will apply `com.jfrog.artifactory` plugin (if not already applied) and prepare package including jar, sources and pom 
to publish to artifactory. 

Note, that by default jar and sources also created, in example we just override some parameters. Of course, it is possible 
to disable generation of some parts of package and it will be also removed from package published to artifactory.

### ShadowJar

Kosogor includes simplified facade to `com.github.johnrengelman.shadow`.

```kotlin
shadowJar {
    jar {
        archiveName = "archive.jar"
        mainClass = "tanvd.example.MainKt"
    }
}
```

This code will apply `com.github.johnrengelman.shadow` if it is not already applied. Then it will override some of the defaults
of shadowJar plugin with values passed with DSL. In example we override the name of resulting archive and mainClass (which is pushed
to manifest). By default destination dir for shadowJar is `$global_build_dir/shadow` but you can also override it.

## More?

The priority for Kosogor plugins is to make Gradle simple and concise for everyday use. Feel free to add issues on extending
Kosogot with facades for the plugins/systems you use. It is probable that such issues will be implemented in Kosogor itself
or derivations plugins will occur (like `kosogor-js`, why not).

## Examples
